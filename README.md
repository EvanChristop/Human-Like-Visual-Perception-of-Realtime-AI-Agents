Abstract—Stealth mechanics in video games rely heavily on the ability of the NPC to visually identify the player in a realistic manner. Traditionally, this was achieved by a combination of several parameters, including the light level of the player’s surroundings and their stance. As effective as these parameters are in providing a predictable and reliable result, they miss out on more complex concepts like camouflage blending, silhouetting and occlusion which are key components of human pattern identification. The idea behind this paper is to train a Neural Network to take a low-resolution snapshot of the player’s character from the NPC’s point of view, and evaluate the confidence based on that snapshot. Combined with ground-truth values like the distance to the player and their movement speed, this approach should provide a more accurate confidence estimation than traditional methods, contributing to a more complex but immersive experience.
